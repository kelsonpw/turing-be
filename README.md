# Turing Back End Challenge

To complete this challenge, you need to ensure all route returns a similar response object as described in our API guide.
To achieve this goal

- You will have to fix the existing bugs
- Implement the incomplete functions,
- Add test cases for the main functions of the system.
- Use Dockerfile to the root of the project to run the app in docker environment
